# CIFAR10-CoreML

This repository, "CIFAR10-CoreML", is a project for creating a CoreML model using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The CIFAR-10 dataset is widely used and consists of 60,000 32x32 color images divided into 10 classes. This project learns from these images to create a model that accurately classifies new images. This model can be used for image recognition tasks on iOS devices.
